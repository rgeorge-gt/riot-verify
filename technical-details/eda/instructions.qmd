#Introduction

This analyses performs basic EDA to provide a high level picture of the cleaned TFT dataset. First, I am only looking at Version 15.22. Different game versions have balance patches which can affect gameplay in major ways. 

This EDA begins with a basic info and descriptive statistics of the int and float fields. Then a histogram was made to get a general view of the distributions.The results of this showed some high degree of bias so the skew and kurtosis was taken. num_3star, num_cost3, 2.258098, 3.439884 had skew > 1. For kurtosis, game_length = 29 and gold_left = 12. Based on these results, gold_left was an incredibly biased varaible i needed to consider when performing supervised and unsupervised learning. I also made a correlation matrix, and pairplot to see if any notable relationships among data was formed.

Finally, to get a sense of unit popularity and team comps, I created a bar chart of the top 10 most used champions and a correlation heatmap of units. The most popular units were Braum, KSante, Udyr, Swain, Zyra, JarvanIV, Leona, LeeSin, Vi, and Janna.

As for the heatmap results, there were some notable correlations in Braum + Swain, Braum + Zyra, Janna + JarvanIV. When I try to determine comps, I wouldlike to see if these champions are frequently seen or the pairings I found are present.
