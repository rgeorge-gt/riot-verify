## Introduction

The goal of this project is to identify the most important factors that determine player placement in high-level Teamfight Tactics (TFT) games. Two related research questions were explored:

  1) Which variables have the greatest impact on overall placement among top-ranked players?
  2) Which variables are most predictive of finishing in first place?

To answer these questions, two machine learning models were used:

  1) Random Forest Regressor — to predict a player's numerical placement
  2) Random Forest Classifier — to predict whether a player finished first (binary outcome)

Random Forest models were chosen because they handle nonlinear relationships, do not require normalization or scaling, and naturally provide feature importance rankings. This makes them well-suited for gameplay-derived variables that differ widely in scale and distribution.

The dataset included various gameplay metrics such as gold remaining, number of items used, total champions fielded, and distribution of champion star levels and costs. These features were used to train both models after performing standard train–test splits.

What are the most significant factors that determine placement at top level play?
What are the most significant factors that determine first place?

To best awnser this, I used Random Forest Regressor. My choices was due to the fact Random Forest Regressor does not require normalization, feature scaling, or linearity assumptions. For determining first place, I decided on Random Forest Classifer given that the outcome Im trying to predict is a binary categorical variable.

## Methods
Random Forest Regressor:
  - A Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that builds many decision trees and averages their predictions. It performs well on nonlinear data and identifies which features contribute most to prediction accuracy.

Random Forest Classifier:
  - A Random Forest Classifier uses the same ensemble strategy but outputs categorical predictions. In this case, the model predicted whether a player achieved first place (1) or not (0).

Feature Definitions
The following gameplay features were used:

gold_left — Gold remaining when the game ends
total_items — Number of completed or component items used
num_units — Total number of champions deployed
num_1star / 2star / 3star — Count of champions by star level
num_cost1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 — Count of champions by shop cost

Several variables were intentionally omitted, including time_eliminated, total_damage, and game_length, because they strongly correlate with placement and would cause leakage, making the model trivially predict outcomes.

Model Training

The dataset was split using train_test_split.
For the classifier predicting first place, the split used:
stratify = y1
Stratify was applied because first place finishes accounted for 12.5% of the total dataset.

## Results
Random Forest Regressor
Initial model performance:
MAE = 0.548
MSE = 0.536
RMSE = 0.732

After the train–test split:

MAE = 1.168
MSE = 2.261
RMSE = 1.504

Despite omitted variable bias, these values indicate reasonably strong performance given the inherent randomness of TFT.

Important Predictors:

total_items ≈ 0.30
num_2star
gold_left
num_units
num_3star

The most dominant factor was items.

Random Forest Classifier

Below are metrics of validity:

Accuracy = 0.880
Precision = 0.531
Recall = 0.386
F1 = 0.447
ROC-AUC = 0.878

Accuracy and ROC-AUC are strong, but Precision, Recall, and F1 are relatively weak, likely due to the rarity of first-place finishes and the difficulty of modeling endgame volatility.

The most important factors were:
gold_left ≈ 0.25
total_items
num_units
num_2star

## Conclusions:

Across both models, four features consistently emerged as the most important:

Items
Gold left over
Number of 2-star champions
Total units deployed

Interestingly, the total number of champions was less predictive than itemization and gold economy. This suggests that TFT success at top level play depends more on quality of units (upgrades + items) rather than simply quantity of units.
