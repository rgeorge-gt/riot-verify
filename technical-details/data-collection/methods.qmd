All of the player match data was collected using Riot Games’ official Teamfight Tactics API. Identifiers of players rank (Grandmaster, and Challenger) from North America (NA1) were preset. From this population, a simple random sample of 250 players of each rank were selected. The 25 most recent games played by these players were then selected. This data was then stored as raw JSON files to latter be processed in the data processing step.
