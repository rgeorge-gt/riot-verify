# Summary

This section should be written for a **technical audience**, focusing on detailed analysis, factual reporting, and clear presentation of data. The following serves as a guide, but feel free to adjust as needed.

## Challenges

- Getting the API key operating correctly was an incredibly tedious process. After getting the API key approval, my TFT account wouldnt synch with my Riot Games account preventing me from using the key. This took about 11 hours to resolve.
- I originally planned to obtain a simple random sample of 250 Grandmaster, and Challenger rank players (the two highest level player ranks) and their 25 most recent game data. However, the API has run limitations which caused my code to only pull 422 players. 
- After some inital evaluation, I wanted to include the next lower rank (Master) to better diversify the playerbase (Challenger + Grandmaster accounted for <1% of the playerbase while Master is 2.2%). 
- However, when I ran the script the RIOT API had no data to pull due to the new build coming out.
- Discuss any technical challenges faced during the project, such as data limitations, computational issues, or obstacles encountered during analysis.
- Explain unexpected results and their technical implications.
- Identify areas for future work, including potential optimizations, further analysis, or scaling solutions.
- There are many areas for future work that would be intresting. Comparing game versions to see if balance patches had achieved the deseriable outcome. 

## Benchmarks

- Based on my personal gameplay experience, my expectations for most relevant variables to determine match placement would be game length, damage dealt. These were proven correct when I performed 
- Outside of those, I had thought the presecne of 3 star units would nearly guarentee upper placement. 

## Conclusion and Future Steps

- Summarize the key technical points and outcomes of the project.
- Suggest potential improvements or refinements to this part of the project.
- Based on the results, provide actionable recommendations for further research or optimization efforts.
