## Introduction
Over the past fifteen years, esports has evolved from a niche hobby into a global entertainment and competitive ecosystem, drawing millions of players, viewers, and investors worldwide. Major publishers, including Capcom, Riot Games, and Bandai Namco, now host international tournament circuits with prize pools rivaling traditional sports. For example, Capcom’s 2024 Capcom Cup awarded $1.5 million to its champion.

Released in 2019 by Riot Games, Teamfight Tactics (TFT) has become one of the most influential titles in the auto-battler genre. The game challenges players to manage resources efficiently, navigate random elements, and adapt strategically in real time.

As TFT’s community and competitive scene expanded, so did the importance of understanding how players make decisions and what factors ultimately determine success. For developers, individual players, esports teams, and marketing strategists, insights into player behavior can guide content updates, balance patches, monetization systems, and engagement strategies.

This report explores the underlying factors that influence competitive performance in TFT and demonstrates how data-driven analysis can reveal meaningful patterns in player outcomes.

## Purpose
This report aims to identify the gameplay variables that most strongly determine competitive success in Teamfight Tactics. Specifically, this analysis investigates:

1) Which variables most strongly influence overall player placement
2) Which factors are most predictive of finishing in first place.
3) What are the most popular comps used at top level play?
4) What comp consistently places the highest?
5) What is the most commonly used Champion at Top level play?

For this study, only Grandmaster and Challenge level match data from Version 15.22 was used to ensure that the insights reflect strategic behavior at the highest levels of play rather than general gameplay. 

Although the technical models underpinning the analysis are complex, this report is written for a non-technical audience, including marketing teams, esports stakeholders, and business leaders. The goal is to demonstrate how machine-learning insights can support smarter decisions around game balance, player engagement, and competitive design.

## Key Findings
- The most successful comp found at top level play lacked a high consistency in the champion selection.
- The most popular comp consisted of 
- Across the 11 analyzed comps, the average placement range was less than one placement, indicating an exceptionally well-balanced metagame in Patch 15.22
- While Braum was the popular unit, he did not appear on the best placing or most common comp.

## Methodology Overview

All of the data was collected from Riot Games TFT API. The 25 most recent matches were collected from a simple random sample of 422 Grandmaster and Challenger ranked players. 
Random Forest Regression was used to determine which variables most strongly influence overall placement.
Random Forest Classification was used to predict the likelihood of finishing in first place.
Evaluation metrics included MAE, MSE, RMSE for regression and Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and ROC-AUC for classification.

## Conclusions
The video game industry—particularly in the context of esports—produces vast amounts of data that can be leveraged by developers to create insights into gameplay design, balance patches, and player behavior. By applying machine-learning techniques to high-level TFT match data, this report demonstrates that meaningful insights emerge regarding the highest levels of play. 

While the models used in this study highlight specific gameplay variables that affect outcomes at the highest level of play, they provide a window of insight into the current competitive balance of TFT. Understanding how top players adapt to meta shifts can assist developers in making informed patch decisions, while helping esports organizations and players themselves optimize strategies for consistent competitive success.

At its core, this project highlights something I’ve come to appreciate deeply: video games are overflowing with analytical potential. Every decision, every roll, every pivot creates a data trail that tells a story. Unlocking that data causes patterns to emerge, and a deeper understanding of the game and the player begins to emerge. As this report shows, the analytics potential within esports is massive, and we are only scratching the surface of what can be done.
