## Project Introduction

**Title: ** Statistical analysis of TeamFight Tactics high level Gameplay

**Motivation: ** The motivation came from my intrest in the application of data science in the video game industry. In November 2025, Riot Games posted an opening for a Teamfight Tactics (TFT) Insights Analyst summer internship. After downloading TFT and playing the game, I enjoyed the various strategic elements of the gameplay

I hope this work demonstrates how data science can support decision-making in esports analytics—a field that continues to grow in relevance both academically and professionally.

## Research Questions

- What are the most common units found?
- What are the most common units found at top 4 placement?
- How does unit star level distribution units correlate to placement?
-  
-

## Literature Review 1 
**Title:** Predicting Teamfight Tactics Results with Machine Learning Techniques. 
https://researchportal.hkr.se/en/studentTheses/predicting-teamfight-tactics-results-with-machine-learning-techni-5/

**Summary:** This undergraduate thesis investigates whether machine learning models traditionally used to predict outcomes in professional sports translates to esports. Teamfight Tactics is used as the test case, and the authors construct feature sets based on board state, itemization, synergies, and unit upgrades to determine their predictive power.

**Key Findings:**

- Determined that there is a pattern in a team that leads to higher win rates.
- Esports data contains high dimensonality and a large number of data points. 

**Takeaway:** 

## Literature Review 2
**Title:** E-Sports Analytics: A Primer and Resource for Student Research Projects and Lesson Plans
https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1242004.pdf

**Summary:** This article provides an overview of esports analytics as an emerging academic domain. It outlines common analytical techniques used in competitive games—such as classification, clustering, and player behavioral modeling—and discusses the challenges caused by dynamic rulesets and patch updates.

**Key Findings:**

- 
-  

**Takeaway:** 

## Literature Review 3
**Title:** ”Getting Mortdogged”; How high-ranking players experience randomness in Teamfight Tactics (TFT)
https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2%3A1805620/FULLTEXT01.pdf

**Summary:** This bachelor thesis explores how top-tier TFT players perceive randomness and probability within the game. Through qualitative interviews, the authors capture how players reason about rolling odds, shop variance, and combat randomness—and how these perceptions influence strategic decisions.

**Key Findings:**

- TFT and AutoBattler video games lack a lot of academic research despite high popularity.
- Controlled randomness (e.g., random augment selection) enhances replayability, making the game strategically richer without overshadowing skill. 

**Takeaway:** 



## What to Include on This Page
### Create an "About You" Page  

- Develop your "About You" page. You can reuse content from previous assignments.
- You can include the content here or on a separate page.
   - It’s recommended to create one "About You" page for all DSAN projects, with links to your various class projects.

### Create a Landing Page for Your Project  

- Summarize your topic, its significance, related work, and the questions you plan to explore.
- Draft an introduction with at least **5 research questions**. These may evolve as your project progresses, since data science is an iterative process.
- Include your data science questions on this page.

### Literature review

Once you decide on a topic, you should `ALWAYS START WITH A LITERATURE REVIEW`, this is particularly important for academic projects.

The literature review is the most important part of most projects. 

It allows you to; 

* 1. Determine what is already known and what has already been tried, so that you `don't re-invent the wheel`.
* 2. It makes you more of a subject matter expert, allowing you to `ask the right questions`, `target impactful projects`, and `communicate with other professionals`.

> Doing a project that you think will change the world, only to find at the end that a very similar version of your project was already done in the 1980's, isn't a great use of time.

In this section, please do a literature review and cite at least **3 academic publications** per group member, and include **internal academic citations**.

**Optional**: Consider using LLM tools to 10X your literature review, e.g. instead of focusing on 3 papers, aim for 30 or more

By following these steps, you can 10X the efficiency of your literature review process, gaining more insights while minimizing the time spent on manual reading.

1. **Expand Your Literature Search**  
   Aim to gather a larger pool of papers. Use academic databases (Google Scholar, arXiv, etc.) to find relevant studies and ensure a broad scope.

2. **Skim the Abstracts**  
   Read the abstracts of each paper to quickly understand their focus and identify those most relevant to your topic. Prioritize these papers for deeper analysis.

3. **Use LLM Tools for Summarization**  
   Upload the selected papers to an LLM tool capable of text summarization. Have it condense the main points of each paper into a concise, manageable summary (e.g., condense hundreds of pages into a 10-page summary). Carefully review this summary to absorb the key insights.

4. **Leverage Interactive LLM Tools**  
   Use tools like NotebookLM or other AI-based text digesters to ask specific, targeted questions about the papers:
   - Example questions:
     - "In the papers uploaded, did any of them explore XYZ?"
     - "Which paper is most closely related to the following project idea: [explain idea]?"
   These tools will help you quickly extract relevant information without re-reading entire papers.


## Additional Ideas for things to include 

- **Audience**: Who is this for? Data professionals, businesses, researchers, or curious readers.
- **Headline**: A captivating title introducing the data science theme (e.g., "Unlocking Insights Through Data Stories").
- **Introduction**: A brief, engaging overview of what the website offers (e.g., data-driven stories, insights, or case studies).
- **Questions You Are Addressing**: What do you hope to learn?
- **Motivation**: Explain why this topic matters, highlighting the importance of data in solving real-world problems.
- **Key Topics**: List the main focus areas (e.g., machine learning, data visualization, predictive modeling).
- **Use Cases/Examples**: A brief teaser of compelling stories or case studies you’ve worked on.
- **Call to Action**: Invite visitors to explore the content, follow along, or contact you for more information.
- **Visual/Infographic**: Add a simple graphic or visual element to make the page more dynamic.
