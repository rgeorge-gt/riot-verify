	abstract = {We developed a gloss-free model to predict English text sequences for American Sign Language (ASL) videos. Our approach employs DINOv2, a Vision Transformer (ViT), for robust video feature extraction. These features are adjusted and normalized via linear projection for better training stability. To capture temporal dependencies between video frames, we use an LSTM decoder. For text generation, we leverage the BART tokenizer, a powerful pretrained language model, to process ground-truth captions. We experimented with combining both sentence-level and word-level ASL videos in the training dataset. This design allows our model to encode visual information from videos and generate corresponding textual descriptions. Our training datasets were: the WLASL Dataset, a collection of 11980 ASL videos representing 2000 English words as well as the How2Sign Dataset, consisting of more than 80 hours of parallel corpora of sign videos,including their respective speech, English transcripts, and depth information. Our metrics for testing were primarily Cross-entropy loss and BLEU, a standard metric for translation performance. Our best-performing model given sign video representations achieved a BLEU score of 11.35\%, compared to 8.03\% in another published paper’s model trained and tested on How2Sign. We found that mixing the training dataset with word-level data and sentence-level did not improve the model performance and increased the variance of the dataset.},

	abstract = {Electronic sports (e-sports) can be defined as digital games played competitively for an audience (Hodge et al., 2017). With a global consumer base of roughly 450 million people and projected 2019 revenues of US\$1.1 billion, the e-sports industry continues to grow (Pannekeet, 2019). Behind this growth is a thriving ecosystem which includes e-sports game publishers, esports players and coaches, e-sports content producers, e-sports consumers, and more. As this ecosystem flourishes, so too flourishes an e-sports labor market, a portion of which comprises esports analytics jobs. Demand for e-sports analytics is expected to increase significantly in the coming years in the same way that demand for sports analytics increased after the 2004 publication of Michael Lewis’s Moneyball (Davenport, 2014). Given current and anticipated demand for e-sports analytics, some universities might do well to prepare students for e-sports analytics careers. To this end, this article serves as a primer and resource for student research projects and lesson plans around e-sports performance analytics. This objective is served through four main sections. In the first section, the intelligence needs that fuel the growth of e-sports performance analytics are described. The second and third sections provide practical and detailed information about e-sports data collection. The fourth section draws from the authors’ analysis of postings for e-sports analytics jobs to discuss two broad areas of e-sports analytics work: attribute creation for visualizations and dashboards; and machine learning modeling. The article concludes with a brief discussion of popular programming languages and software applications for e-sports analytics.},
